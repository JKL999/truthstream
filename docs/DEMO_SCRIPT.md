## Backup Claims

**If verdicts don't appear quickly, use these stronger signals:**

### Alternative Pro-AI Claims
- "DALL-E 2 generated over 2 million images per day in 2023"
- "GitHub Copilot helps developers write 55% of their code as of 2024"
- "The AI writing assistant market grew 300% year-over-year in 2023"

### Alternative Anti-AI Claims
- "DeviantArt banned AI-generated art after 200,000 user complaints in 2023"
- "The EU AI Act requires watermarking of all AI-generated content as of 2024"
- "Getty Images filed a lawsuit for $1.8 billion against Stability AI in 2023"

---

## Timing Notes

- **Per speaker turn**: 15-20 seconds
- **Spacebar toggle**: 2-3 seconds
- **Wait for verdict**: 3-5 seconds (don't rush!)
- **Total debate**: 4-5 minutes
- **Wrap-up**: 30-60 seconds

---

## Troubleshooting

**If no verdicts appear:**
1. Check console for `[B] Gemini Message` - proves Speaker B fix worked
2. Look for "üîç GROUNDING METADATA" in console - shows Google Search triggered
3. Try simpler claims with clear numbers
4. Speak slower and more clearly
5. Ensure good internet connection

**If transcripts stuck on one speaker:**
1. Verify closure bug fix is applied (activeSpeakerRef)
2. Check that you're pressing spacebar between speakers
3. Look for purple bubbles (Speaker B) - should alternate with blue (Speaker A)

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **At least 6-8 verdicts** appear
‚úÖ **Mix of True/Mostly True/Mixed** labels shown
‚úÖ **Both Speaker A and B** generate verdicts
‚úÖ **Auto-scroll** keeps latest verdict visible
‚úÖ **Transcripts** properly alternate blue/purple
‚úÖ **Spacebar toggle** works smoothly
‚úÖ **Sources** are clickable with dates

## Post-Demo Q&A Prep

**Q**: How accurate is the fact-checking?
**A**: It depends on Google Search results and our prompt engineering. We've tuned it for quantitative claims where ground truth is easier to verify.

**Q**: Can it handle opinion-based claims?
**A**: It's optimized for factual, quantifiable claims. Subjective statements get marked "Unverifiable" or don't trigger verdicts.

**Q**: What happens if sources conflict?
**A**: The system labels it "Mixed" and shows both perspectives in the rationale.

**Q**: Why Gemini Live instead of other models?
**A**: Gemini 2.0 Flash has built-in Google Search grounding, real-time audio transcription, and tool calling - perfect for live fact-checking.
